# PrediKCT

C++ package for converting desired end-effector motion in Cartesian space to joint velocities for redundant robotic manipulators. This package allows conversion of desired Cartesian velocity to joint velocities on any URDF-specified robotic arm with 7+ degrees of freedom. Users can also pass in a custom operator model to be used in prediction of future timesteps. Based on the paper "The Predictive Kinematic Control Tree: Enhancing Teleoperation of Redundant Robots through Probabilistic User Models".
